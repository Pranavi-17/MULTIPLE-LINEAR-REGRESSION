# Project Title :Prediction of  starts ups success using Machine Learning algorithm..

# Tools & Technology:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python Programming Language
3. Numpy (Python Library)
4. Pandas(Python Library)
5. Matplot(Python Library)
6. Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
According to the world survey records for 50 startup companies including their profit and loss,as a machine learning specalist my task is that predict the success rate in future

# Project Approch:
1. Importing the libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Encoding categorical data
4. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
5. Training the Multiple Linear Regression model on the Training set
6. Predicting the Test set results
7. Accuracy of Tain and Test data

# Final result:
